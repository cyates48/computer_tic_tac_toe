# computer_tic_tac_toe

I designed a computer bot that would try to win at Tic-Tac-Toe using predictions 
from an ID3 tree (created from a data file that contains all end game solutions!). I 
created the ID3 tree using various functions from Lines 4-122. Following that, the rest
of the functions serve to simulate the game, including the player and computer moves (and 
more functions that assist the computer to make its next move).
